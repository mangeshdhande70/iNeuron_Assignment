* Using Constructor we can initialize the value of the Object while Object Creation
  & matching constructor will call while creating object.
  
* Every class have at-least one constructor if you not create any constructor then and only then
  JVM will create default constructor.
  
* In every constructor there is a super() method or this() method, only one can be there not both at time.

* super() method is used to call parent class constructor with matching constructor parameter & this()
  method is used to call itself matching constructor.
