Interface
============

1. Interface means Specific Requirement Service.
2. If we don't know about the implementation then we can go for interface and for loose coupling.
3. Inside interface you can't have concrete method means you can't declare body of method in interface
   but from java 8 you can create default & static method body.
4. every method inside interface is by default public & abstract. 
5. the variable declared inside interface is by default private and final so, you need to initialize the 
   value of variable while declaring & you can't declare variable of other combinations like (public String variable). 
6. Using interface we can achieve 100% Abstraction.    


abstract
============

1. If we know about the partial implementation then we can go for abstract.
2. Inside abstract class you can have concrete method means you can declare body of methods as well as abstract method.
3. every method inside abstract  class cannot be public & abstract. 
4. the variable declared inside abstract class is not by default private and final & you can declare variable of other combinations like (public String variable). 
5. Using interface we can't achieve 100% Abstraction
